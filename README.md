# HexMapLibrary
working with hexagonal maps in unity made easy.

This library makes working with hexagonal grids and maps an intuitive, easy and maybe even fun process.  
All the details of hexagonal-grid-coordinate systems and the mathematics behind it are abstracted away from you so you can focus on building your game logic using declarative statements.  
We include multiple example scenes displaying some approaches how the library can be used and showing how easily common features like line-of-sight or turn-based movement with movement costs based on map features can be implemented.
